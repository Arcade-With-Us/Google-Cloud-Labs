## ‚úÖ Step 1: Understand the Daily Lab Limit

Before you begin, it's very important to understand the **Daily Lab Limit** system.  
üîó [Daily Lab Limit Explained (PDF)](https://github.com/Arcade-With-Us/Google-Cloud-Labs/blob/main/Google%20Cloud%20Skill%20Badges%20Ultimate%20Quick%20Guide/Daily_Lab_Limit.pdf)

This guide explains:
- How many labs you can attempt daily
- When the limits reset
- How to use them smartly with real examples

‚ö†Ô∏è **Pro Tip:** Avoid retrying failed labs too many times. They still count against your daily limit!

## üéØ Step 2: Complete All Arcade Events

Visit the official Arcade Event page here:  
üîó [Google Cloud Arcade Events](https://go.cloudskillsboost.google/arcade)

Complete all available and upcoming events:

üîó [Arcade Syllabus - Lab-Free Courses](https://rsvp.withgoogle.com/events/arcade-facilitator/syllabus)

Complete **only the courses listed** in the syllabus under **"Lab-Free Courses"**.  
‚úÖ These courses don‚Äôt use any lab credits but still award Arcade Points!

‚ùå Don‚Äôt waste time on unlisted or unrelated lab-free courses. They won't count.

### üî• Start with:
